# Dont-Spray
Hack4Pan submission

Don't Spray is a robot that aims to make your aim better. If you spray in Valorant (hold the mouse down for 800 ms+), you'll be sprayed with a water bottle. It'll teach you to tap instead of spray in a pretty effective and fun way. Either get gud or get wet

Uses Arduino hardware and C++
